The  `RSVPForm`  component in  `RSVPForm.jsx` is a form with these fields in this order:

1.  "Name" input field.
2.  Dropdown with the following age ranges: Prefer not to say, 0-19, 20-39, 40-59, 60+
3.  "New Member" checkbox, set to unchecked by default.
4.  "Comment" input field.
5.  Submit button.

Upon submission, each value is logged,  _together, in a single statement,_  to the console and clear the fields in the form.
